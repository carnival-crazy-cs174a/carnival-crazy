### Summary:
   Carnival Crazy involves a spinning ferris wheel in the background with
implemented games for users to play, such as bucket ball and balloon darts. 
There also exists non-interactive booths acting as a concession stand, 
milk bottle ring toss, and duck picking game. 
   The advanced features involve collision detection and physics-based 
simulation. Collision detection is implemented when a dart comes into 
contact with a balloon, causing the balloon to pop. Physics-based 
simulation is implemented with the parabolic trajectory of the basketball.
