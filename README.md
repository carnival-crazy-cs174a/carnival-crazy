## Final Report

### Summary

Carnival Crazy involves a spinning ferris wheel in the background with
implemented games for users to play, such as bucket ball and balloon darts.
There also exists non-interactive booths acting as a concession stand,
milk bottle ring toss, and duck picking game.

The advanced features involve collision detection and physics-based
simulation.

### How to Run

Run `python3 server.py` (or whatever command is used to invoke Python).

### How to Play

Use WASD to move forward, left, back, or right, respectively. Use Z to move
down, spacebar to move up. Pan the camera by pressing the mouse and dragging it
around.

to reset the current dart's position so it can be thrown again. Pressing X again
spawns a new dart (note that each dart is a different color).
